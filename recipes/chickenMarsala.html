        Wood-grilled and topped with mushrooms and our Lombardo
        Marsala wine sauce
    </p>

    <p>
        A staple at Italian restaurants, chicken marsala is usually sautéed.
         In our grilled version, the breast is topped with a sauce of marsala,
          mushrooms, and prosciutto. Use the sauce to top grilled veal, steak,
           or pork chops.

    <h4>Chicken</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless and skinless chicken breast halves, 7 to 8 ounces each</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Grill Baste or olive oil</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons Grill Seasoning</li>
        <li>Finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the sauce, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. 
            Add the prosciutto and onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion softens, 
            about 2 minutes more. Sprinkle with the flour and stir well. 
            Stir in the marsala and broth and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring often, until reduced to
            about 1 cup, about 5 minutes. 
            Set aside. (The sauce can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 hours.)</li>
        <li>Prepare an outdoor grill for direct cooking over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cut each breast half in half crosswise to make a total of 8 chicken breast pieces. 
            Brush with the grill baste. S
            eason with the grill seasoning.</li>
        <li>Brush the grill grate clean. 
            Lightly oil the grate. Place the chicken on the grill. 
            Cook, with the lid closed as much as possible, turning after 5 minutes, 
            until the chicken is nicely browned and feels firm when the top is pressed with a 
            finger, about 10 minutes total. 
            Remove from the grill.</li>
        <li>Reheat the sauce in the skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly.
            Remove from the heat. One tablespoon at a time, add the remaining butter 
            and stir until incorporated into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Place 2 chicken pieces on each serving plate. 
            Spoon equal amounts of the sauce over each serving, sprinkle with parsley, 
            and serve hot.</li>
