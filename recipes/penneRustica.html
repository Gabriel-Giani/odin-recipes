        Shrimp, grilled chicken & smoked prosciutto and parmesean baked in a
        creamy cheese sauce.

        Romano's top-requested item is so popular they've even trademarked
         the name. Grilled chicken, shrimp, prosciutto, and penne pasta bathed
          in a creamy gratinata sauce is topped with cheese and paprika, and
           baked until the top is a crispy brown. There's a distinct smoky flavor
            that comes from the smoked prosciutto used by the chain, and you might
             have a hard time finding such a unique item at your deli. No big deal.
              Just use regular prosciutto, and have the deli cut it pretty thick-1/8-inch will do.
               My Macaroni Grill Penne Rustica copycat recipe will still work, since you'll get smoky
                hints from the grilled chicken and shrimp.

        The chain serves up the entr√©e in a wide, shallow baking dish that comes to you straight
         from the restaurant's salamander overhead oven/broiler. If you don't have any baking
          dishes like that, try using 9-inch glass pie dishes. These make for a great presentation,
           especially when served hot right to the table, garnished with a sprig of rosemary and a
            few sliced pimentos on top. Be sure to get the sliced pimentos, not diced. You want long
             pieces just like those they use at the restaurant.
